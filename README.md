Automatically add/update ingress rule in AWS security group

# üö© Pre-requisites

 - awscli (if not, install [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and configure aws profile)
 - curl (`apt-get install curl` / `brew install curl`)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Clone the repo 
`git clone https://github.com/arddluma/aws-auto-sg.git`

You have to have installed awscli with valid credentials!
**Make sure you have properly set default region using aws configure command or export as variable like this:**
e.g `export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=eu-central-1`

Edit `magic.sh` as following:
- line 3 `SG_ID` add correct security group rule ID `sg-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
- line 4 `SG_DESCRIPTION` add proper security group rule description. e.g `Office Access port 22`
  ***(Note description has to be unique because script queries based on description set!)***
- line 5 `AWS_PROFILE` add AWS profile configured.
- line 6 `PORT` set port you want to whitelist e.g `22`.

# üöÄ Usage

```
    chmod +x magic.sh
    ./magic.sh
```

# üìñ What is covered

- First time applying the rule
- If your IP changes, it will update the rule with new IP
- If your IP has not changed and you try to re-create same rule it shows that rule exist and IP is  already whitelisted.
